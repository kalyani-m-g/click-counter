What I Learned
Learned how to manage state in JS (a simple numeric variable) and update the DOM dynamically when clicking the button. 
Built a reusable click handler that’s clean and minimal—no frameworks, just vanilla JavaScript and HTML. 
Gained experience validating UI state and handling button event flows correctly.

 Favorite Feature
Adding a click counter that updates in real-time—instantly showing users how many clicks they’ve made—is both intuitive and satisfying to implement.

 Next Features I’d Add
A Reset button to clear the count back to zero.
A Maximum limit, e.g. stop counting after a certain number of clicks or play a sound.
Save click count using localStorage, so the number persists across sessions.
